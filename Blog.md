CS110 Reddit Data Analysis Project Blog

The code that runs here is a file-based analysis of Reddit Posts from the Donald Trump subreddit.

The code works by asking the user for a desired word to look for and then goes through the file and identifies which
lines the desired word appears on and how many times the word appears over the entire set of posts. The way that it goes
through the file is the buffered reader rather than the scanner, mainly because of the wordy nature of the posts.

The work that the bot does opens the door for data analytics, as it is an introduction to a field growing rapidly in Comp Sci. 
At its core, it is just a program that goes through a file, but with a more thorough program and a different data set, the 
information gained from data analysis can be useful for a plethora of application. Political analyses, data mining, research studies,
and more are just a small sample of the probably applications of these types of programs.

The data set user here, the Reddit posts, are quite interesting because they show the contentious political opinions of The Donald
during the 2016 presidential election, the most important worldwide event at the time. Searching for everyone's favorite four letter word
shows a bunch of hits, along with the other four letter word, "Trump."
